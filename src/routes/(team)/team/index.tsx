  name: "Ginger",
  role: "Facilitator",
  description: "Ginger took her first pottery course over 35 years ago and was immediately drawn to the tactile joy of shaping clay. Over time, she shifted from making things to discovering in clay a grounding and fulfilling experience of connection - to self, to others and to the earth.\n\nThe vision for earthen vessels was seeded by a small pottery community in Venezuela. Years later, that inspiration grew to the creation of the first â€˜Touch the Earth' workshops. Ginger blends clay workshops with her studies at The Centre for Courage and Renewal - a global community founded by Parker J Palmer, whose work centers on living and leading with integrity. In earthen vessels, clay becomes a practice of slowing down, allowing creativity to open up new possibilities.\n\nIn 2012 Ginger also founded Hintonburg Pottery, rooted in the local community, a studio that welcomes children and adults and offers ceramic artists a place to showcase their work.",

Over the years, this practice deepened into a passionâ€”not just for creativity, but for sharing it with others. She is driven by a desire to connect hearts and nurture community well-being. At earthen vessels, she has found both a creative home and a space to pour her love for community. As she shapes clay, she draws inspiration from the wonder of the natural world and the tertiaryâ€™s generous gifts.
