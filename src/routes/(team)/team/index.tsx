  name: "Ginger",
  role: "Facilitator",
  description: "Ginger took her first pottery course over 35 years ago and was immediately drawn to the tactile joy of shaping clay. Over time, she shifted from making things to discovering in clay a grounding and fulfilling experience of connection - to self, to others and to the earth.\n\nThe vision for earthen vessels was seeded by a small pottery community in Venezuela. Years later, that inspiration grew to the creation of the first ‘Touch the Earth' workshops. Ginger blends clay workshops with her studies at The Centre for Courage and Renewal - a global community founded by Parker J Palmer, whose work centers on living and leading with integrity. In earthen vessels, clay becomes a practice of slowing down, allowing creativity to open up new possibilities.\n\nIn 2012 Ginger also founded Hintonburg Pottery, rooted in the local community, a studio that welcomes children and adults and offers ceramic artists a place to showcase their work.",

      "Mary's journey with clay began in the embrace of family, surrounded by mountains, forests, and lakes. Over the years, this practice deepened into a passion—not just for creativity, but for sharing it with others. She is driven by a desire to connect hearts and nurture community well-being. At earthen vessels, she has found both a creative home and a space to pour her love for community. As she shapes clay, she draws inspiration from the wonder of the natural world and the tertiary’s generous gifts. Mary's enthusiasm and strong skills bring added energy to earthen vessels where participants feel inspired, supported and empowered in their creative exploration.",

Through her journey with clay, she has discovered not only a creative outlet but also a deep sense of presence and grounding. Natalie spent 20 years working in the field of mental health. Her work took her beyond Canada, as she lived and served in communities in East Africa and Haiti, providing individual and group support, teaching, and fostering connection. Natalie is excited to bring together her love of pottery and facilitation experience to earthen vessels.",

    Our facilitators and friends gathered to share their creative vision for earthen vessels.  
    Diane Black worked with these visions to create our rich logo.  
    Together from our shared imaginations, Diane designed a pinch pot holding water to remind us  
    of the life that flows through clay, hands, and community.
