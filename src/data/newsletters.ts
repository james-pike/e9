Hello friends,

We have three offerings coming up at the studio that invite connection, creativity, and time well spent with clay. We'd love to share them with you.

## Valentine's with Your Bestie 💗

This Valentine's Day, we're inviting you to celebrate love in all its forms. Celebrate friends and close relationships, the people who know you best.

Join us on **Saturday, February 14, 1:30pm**, for a warm, creative afternoon of clay-making designed for the besties in your life! Come together to play and make side-by-side, and leave having made a beautiful mug to treasure.

## Books & Clay Series

We're delighted to welcome Canadian author **Michael Saver** for a special Book & Clay event at the studio on **Saturday, March 7th, 10am**.

*The Lost Village* is Michael's debut novel—a murder mystery set against the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway near Cornwall. It explores young people coming into their identities, and a community grappling with relocation and loss as a village is forever changed.

The event will include a reading and conversation with the author, followed by hands-on clay time where we'll make bowls that reflect themes of place, identity, and transition in our own lives.

**Cost:** $75 per person (includes book which can be picked up at the studio once you register online.)

## Mugs & Bowls (NEW Four-Week Course)

Our upcoming four-week course focuses on hand-building mugs and bowls while exploring rhythm, form, and daily ritual.

This is a slower, deeper dive into clay—ideal for those who want to build skills, refine their touch, and create unique pieces, intended for everyday use.

We hope one (or more!) of these offerings meets you right where you are.

As always, clay is waiting.

Wishing all a peace-filled season.


We’re ending this year with full hearts shaped by clay, curiosity, and community. We created with gratitude and shaped more than objects; we shaped moments and connections!

This year, we were grateful to open our doors to organizations doing meaningful work in our wider community: Soul Space, supporting front-line workers of street outreach; Parkdale Food Centre, feeding neighbors in need; CODE, an international organization advancing literacy for children around the world; and PLEO, supporting parents navigating mental health and addiction challenges in Eastern Ontario.

These gatherings echo something simple and grounding: we all come from the Earth, we’re shaped by our experiences, and we’re stronger when we support one another.

We are looking forward to more gatherings and connections in the New Year!

Creating a Clay Quilt with Soul Space



Like a quilt, a community is stitched together from many pieces. Each person brings their own story, their own care, and their own love. Joined together, they become a shared source of warmth and support.  We thoroughly enjoyed welcoming Soul Space to earthen vessels this past month to create a clay quilt to be brought back to their space as a reminder of the gift and strength of community.


 
New Ventures at earthen vessels



As we continue to grow, listen, learn, and be inspired by our community and partners, we’re thrilled to expand our offerings—and we can’t wait to share what’s ahead. Alongside our ongoing workshops and community partnerships, we’re excited to deepen our connections and reach even further through:

 ![December at earthen vessels](/images/decembergroup.jpeg)


Corporate Events

We have enjoyed offering creative, hands-on clay experiences designed to foster connection, reflection, and collaboration. Perfect for corporate retreats or staff appreciation gatherings. Contact us to discuss what might work for your group.



Private Groups



We’ve also had a lot of fun welcoming groups looking to celebrate life's special moments. Gather around our large creative table to celebrate one another, play, and make something beautiful together. Think about hosting your next birthday, book club, family gathering or evening out with friends at earthen vessels. Contact us to discuss the opportunities.





New 4-Week Courses

In addition to our ongoing workshops, we are introducing a new 4-week Course, Mugs and Bowls.  Join us for a four-week clay journey creating functional mugs and bowls in the gentle rhythm of our zen studio. Each week in this nurturing space, you’ll be invited to slow down, settle into your hands, and discover the quiet creativity that rises when we shape clay with intention.  Classes will be kept small - sign up now!

From our Hands to Yours



You asked, we answered. Visitors are often drawn to the handmade clay pieces that live around the studio, wondering if they’re available to take home. We’re happy to say some are! We’re now set up for retail sales, so if something catches your eye—like these one-of-a-kind doodle mugs—just ask.

As the air turns crisp and the leaves begin to drift, we're welcoming autumn with new offerings at earthen vessels. This season invites us inward—into reflection, into creativity, and into the grounding practice of working with clay. We continue to add new offerings, so there's always something fresh to explore.

## Open House – October 1st, 7 – 9pm

Drop in and visit our quiet studio space. All are welcome! Meet our facilitators, learn more about our programs, and discover the heart of earthen vessels.

During the evening, visitors are invited to:

- Create a meditation clay pinch pot to take home.
- Take part in hands-on demonstrations.
- Explore the beauty of texturing clay and discover how surface design can bring each vessel to life.

## The Yoga of Clay

At earthen vessels, we see making with clay as a process of slowing down, listening, and shaping meaning. Just as yoga invites us into mindful movement, clay invites us into mindful making. With gentle guidance, we can shape not only bowls and mugs, but also moments of presence, bringing more meaning in the process of making.

We look forward to welcoming you into the studio this fall season. For more information please reach out to us at hello@earthenvessels.ca.

Hello dear friends of earth and clay,

We are in the fullness of summer now—sun-warmed days, slow evenings, and the grounding rhythm of hands at work. At earthen vessels, the clay is soft, the kiln is glowing, and the studio hums with creativity and care. We're delighted to share what's unfolding mid-season and what's beginning to take form for the months ahead.

- **Lantern Clay Workshops** invite reflection on our journey inward—through pattern, presence, and earth. These are reflective clay experiences that bring together making and meaning. [Book Now](https://bookeo.com/earthenvessels)
- **Open-like-a-Bowl Workshops** are a poetic vessel-making experience exploring openness, spaciousness, and the quiet beauty of what we hold. [Book Now](https://bookeo.com/earthenvessels)
- **Hug-in-a-Mug Workshops** invite you to hand-build your very own mugs—sturdy, soulful, and shaped with care. Each one holds not just your favorite drink, but the warmth of your presence and intention. [Book Now](https://bookeo.com/earthenvessels)
- **Like The Turtle - Exploring Patience, Persistence and Resilience** is a workshop about the powerful symbol of the turtle—patience, persistence, and resilience. In this workshop, we will explore the symbols of the turtle and what this creature can teach us about our inner world and how we show up in our day-to-day lives. [Book Now](https://bookeo.com/earthenvessels)

Workshops are two and a half hours long and offered at a rate of $125. Clay, supplies, and firings are all included. Each group will be a small gathering of six to eight participants.

In addition to these regular workshops, if you're looking for a private group session, a clay experience for your team or organization, or a meaningful gift experience, we'd be honored to shape something with you.

May your summer continue to offer light, space, and the sweet feel of clay in your hands. We look forward to seeing you in the studio.

If you have suggestions for hand-building clay workshops you'd like to see us design, please reach out to us at hello@earthenvessels.ca—we'd love to hear from you.
