Hello dear friends of earth and clay,

We are in the fullness of summer now—sun-warmed days, slow evenings, and the grounding rhythm of hands at work. At Earthen Vessels, the clay is soft, the kiln is glowing, and the studio hums with creativity and care. We’re delighted to share what’s unfolding mid-season and what’s beginning to take form for the months ahead.

- **Lantern Clay Workshops** invite reflection on our journey inward—through pattern, presence, and earth. These are reflective clay experiences that bring together making and meaning. [Book Now](/book/lantern-clay)
- **Open-like-a-Bowl Workshops** are a poetic vessel-making experience exploring openness, spaciousness, and the quiet beauty of what we hold. [Book Now](/book/open-bowl)
- **Hug-in-a-Mug Workshops** invite you to hand-build your very own mugs—sturdy, soulful, and shaped with care. Each one holds not just your favorite drink, but the warmth of your presence and intention. [Book Now](/book/hug-mug)
- **Like The Turtle - Exploring Patience, Persistence and Resilience** is a workshop about the powerful symbol of the turtle—patience, persistence, and resilience. In this workshop, we will explore the symbols of the turtle and what this creature can teach us about our inner world and how we show up in our day-to-day lives. [Book Now](/book/turtle-resilience)

Workshops are two and a half hours long and offered at a rate of $125. Clay, supplies, and firings are all included. Each group will be a small gathering of six to eight participants.

In addition to these regular workshops, if you're looking for a private group session, a clay experience for your team or organization, or a meaningful gift experience, we’d be honored to shape something with you.

May your summer continue to offer light, space, and the sweet feel of clay in your hands. We look forward to seeing you in the studio.

If you have suggestions for hand-building clay workshops you’d like to see us design, please reach out to us at hello@earthenvessels.ca—we’d love to hear from you.
